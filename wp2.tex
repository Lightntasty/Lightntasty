\workpkg{2}

%% This Work Package deals with the detailed design of the spacecraft
%% subsystems, the revision of the mass and power budgets, and the
%% definition of the final spacecraft architecture.  WP 2.1

%% Timeline : Weeks 3, 4 and 5 (3-weeks total duration)

%% Deadline for Report Delivery: Monday October 8th, 12.00 hours

%% Each report shall include, as a minimum, all the Deliverables
%% listed in the sub-WP descriptions provided below (each deliverable
%% is identified by a unique code, in the form Dx.y.z). The names and
%% student numbers of the authors shall be present on the cover
%% page. The report shall also include a work division table,
%% indicating which group members have contributed to each one of the
%% tasks.  Deliver the printed report to the Teaching Assistant
%% assigned to your group.

\subworkpkg{2.1}

%% Deliverables

%% D2.1.1. For each one of the Tasks and sub-Tasks described above,
%% document in detail your choices, calculations and outcomes. Provide
%% detailed characteristics of the components you have chosen,
%% including their mass, size and power requirements; whereas
%% possible, include pictures and/or drawings of the components.

\deliverable{2.1.1}

%% Tasks

%% Note that all the Tasks below, related to different subsystems of
%% the spacecraft, need to be carried out in parallel, because several
%% key requirements and characteristics of the different subsystems
%% are significantly coupled each other. Hint: divide the whole group
%% into sub-groups (or individuals), each one working on a different
%% subsystem, and plan regular “system engineering meetings”
%% (e.g. daily) to exchange with the other sub-groups the information
%% related to the work done on each subsystem.

\subworkpkg{2.2}

%% Tasks

%% A. Using the result obtained by WP 2.1 (in particular, the
%% requirements and characteristics of the components chosen for the
%% subsystems), define detailed mass and power budgets for the
%% spacecraft.  Clearly indicate the margins that are available.

%% B. Compare the new budgets to the preliminary ones defined in the
%% framework of WP 1, and highlight eventual changes or significant
%% differences.

%% C. Verify that the mass and power budgets are compliant to ALL the
%% mission requirements and, if necessary, re-iterate the subsystems
%% design obtained during WP 2.1.

%% Deliverables

%% D2.2.1. Tables showing the detailed mass and power budgets for the
%% spacecraft.

\deliverable{2.2.1}

\subworkpkg{2.3}

%% Tasks

%% A. Based on the operational requirements, the interfaces and the
%% dimensions of the subsystems and their components, define a
%% detailed architecture of the spacecraft including all the relevant
%% subsystems.

%% B. Draft your detailed spacecraft architecture as a CATIA drawing,
%% and compare it to the preliminary one(s) obtained in the framework
%% of WP 1.

%% Deliverables

%% D2.3.1. CATIA drawing of the spacecraft architecture. The drawing
%% shall include one or more 3D views and the necessary 2D
%% views/cut-offs needed to show the position and interfaces of all
%% subsystems.
