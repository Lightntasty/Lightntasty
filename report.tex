%% Mission Objectives

%% Europa, one of the satellites of Jupiter, is probably the most
%% interesting celestial body in the Solar System due to its unique
%% characteristics, that have led some scientists to theorize a
%% scenario in which it could even be colonized in a far future. This
%% mission will therefore have the goal of better investigating the
%% surface characteristics and the potential habitability of Europa,
%% through a detailed observation of the ice-shell surface of the
%% planet and a characterization of the chemical composition of the
%% surface and the inner oceans below it. The spacecraft payload will
%% be represented by a high-resolution camera, a laser altimeter, an
%% ice-penetrating radar, a set of spectrometers and a thermal camera.
