%% A. Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS)

%% 1. Define the key subsystem requirements and functions (e.g.,
%% spacecraft stabilization and station keeping, precise orientation
%% of the payload instruments, orientation of the solar arrays, etc.).

%% 2. Evaluate whether different modes of operation of the ADCS are
%% needed or not.

%% 3. Evaluate the external and internal disturbances (forces and
%% torques) acting on the spacecraft.

%% 4. Define the type, number and size of attitude sensors and
%% attitude control actuators needed by the spacecraft (note: consider
%% sufficient redundancies!!)

%% 5. Select the sensors and actuators for the spacecraft among
%% commercially existing models, and dimension your subsystem based on
%% the characteristics of the selected components.

%% 6. Develop a block diagram that identifies the various functions
%% that need to be performed by the ADCS software.
